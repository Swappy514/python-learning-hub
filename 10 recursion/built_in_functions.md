# Built-in Functions

Python provides many built-in functions to simplify common tasks:

- `len(obj)`: Returns the length of an object, such as a list or string.
- `max(iterable)`: Returns the maximum item.
- `min(iterable)`: Returns the minimum item.
- `sum(iterable)`: Returns the sum of all elements (numeric).

## Examples:

items = [1, 2, 3, 4,n(items)) # Output: 5

numbers = [10, 20, 5,numbers)) # Output: 30
print(min(numbers)) # Output: 5
print(sum(numbers)) # Output: 65

These functions reduce code complexity and improve readability.
