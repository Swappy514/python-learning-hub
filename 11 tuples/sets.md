Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

Duplicate values are automatically removed.

Sets are mutable; you can add or remove items.

No indexing or slicing, as sets are unordered.

Creating a set:
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} # duplicates ignored
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3}

Adding and Removing
add(item) to add an element.
remove(item) to remove an element.

Membership Testing
Use in to check if an item exists in the set.
