# Loops in Python

Loops let you execute a block of code multiple times, efficiently repeating tasks.

## While Loop

Runs as long as a condition is True:

count = 0
while count < 5:
print("Count:", count)
count += 1

**Output:**
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4

## For Loop

Runs a block of code for each item in a sequence or range:

for i in range(5):
print("Iteration:", i)

**Output:**

Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4

Loops are fundamental to handle repetitive tasks without manual code duplication.
