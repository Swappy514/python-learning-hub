# String Methods within Loops

You can call string methods inside loops to process text.

## Example:

Convert each character in a sentence to uppercase during iteration:

sentence = "python programming"

for char in sentence:
print(char.upper(), end="")
print()

**Output:**

PYTHON PROGRAMMING

Loops combined with string methods enable powerful text manipulation.
