# Industry Example: Process Orders with Loop Control

In real-world applications, loops with control statements manage processing workflows.

### Scenario:

- Skip any missing orders (`None` values).
- Stop processing when reaching a specific order (105).
- Confirm completion if no early stop.

### Code:

orders = [101, 102, None, 104, 105]

for order in orders:
if order is None:
print("Missing order, skipping...")
continue
if order == 105:
print("Reached final order, stopping process.")
break
print(f"Processing order {order}")
else:
print("All orders processed successfully.")

### Output:

Processing order 101
Processing order 102
Missing order, skipping...
Processing order 104
Reached final order, stopping process.

This logic ensures robustness in batch order processing.
