# Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops inside other loops. They are useful when working with multi-dimensional data or patterns.

### Example: Multiplication Table (1 to 5)

for i in range(1, 6):
for j in range(1, 6):
print(f"{i\*j:3}", end=" ")
print()

### Output:

1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 10
3 6 9 12 15
4 8 12 16 20
5 10 15 20 25

Nested loops help in creating tables, matrices, and complex print patterns.
