Industry Example: Recording Employee Data
Scenario:
A small company wants to quickly record and display basic employee details.

This is a typical first step in many real applications—storing and showing basic info as a sequence of assignments and outputs.

Example Code
employee_name = "Priya"
employee_age = 28
department = "Finance"

print("Employee Details:")
print("Name:", employee_name)
print("Age:", employee_age)
print("Department:", department)

Output:
Employee Details:
Name: Priya
Age: 28
Department: Finance

This simple pattern—input/assignment, then output—is a foundation for user registration or HR modules everywhere.
