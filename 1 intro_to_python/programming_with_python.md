Programming with Python
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. Writing your first Python program is as simple as printing text to the console.

Example 1: Printing text
Code
print("Hello, World!")
Output:
Hello, World!

Example 2: Simple Arithmetic
Code
result = 2 + 3
print("2 + 3 =", result)
Output:
2 + 3 = 5

Python can be used interactively (in a shell) or by saving code in a .py file and running it from the command line.
