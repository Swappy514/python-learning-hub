# Lists and Strings

Strings and lists share similarities such as being iterable sequences.

## Examples:

### Iterating over a string:

text = "hello"
for char in text:
print(char, end=' ')
**Output:**
h e l l o

### Iterating over a list:

chars = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
for c in chars:
print(c, end=' ')
**Output:**
h e l l o

Understanding both helps manipulate text and collections effectively.
