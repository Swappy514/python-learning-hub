# Lists

A **list** is a collection of items that is ordered and mutable (you can change items).

## Features

- Items are indexed starting at 0.
- Supports duplicate items.
- Can contain mixed data types.

## Examples:

### Creating a list

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

### Accessing items by index

print(fruits) # apple
print(fruits[-1]) # cherry (last item)

### Modifying list elements

fruits = "blueberry"
print(fruits) # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
Lists are widely used to store multiple related values.
