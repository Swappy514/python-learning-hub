Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean:

Operator Meaning Example Result

> == Equal to a == b True or False
> != Not equal to a != b True or False
>
> > Greater than a > b True or False
> > < Less than a < b True or False
> > = Greater than or equal a >= b True or False
> > <= Less than or equal a <= b True or False

Example:
Code
a = 10
b = 20
print(a < b) # Output: True
Relational operators help in decisions and controlling flow in programs.
